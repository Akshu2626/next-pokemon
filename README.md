## About
This ***Next.js*** frontend web app is a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse and search for Pokemon data from the **Pokemon API**. Built with ***server-side rendering***, it delivers *fast and reliable performance and enhances SEO*. The app features a search bar that utilizes debounce functionality for efficient searches, and **infinite scroll** for effortless browsing of large amounts of data.

This app follows the ***Atomic Design Pattern***, which breaks down the interface into smaller, reusable components. These components are built with *stitches.dev*, a CSS-in-JS library that provides high-performance styles. The app's state management is powered by ***Zustand***, a lightweight and fast state management library for React, while its code quality is improved by TypeScript, a statically typed programming language.

Overall, this app provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users to browse and search for Pokemon data. Its fast performance, responsive design, reusable components, and efficient search and browsing features make it a showcase of the power and flexibility of the Next.js framework.
